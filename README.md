# DataGenerator
This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the authorâ€™s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

Utility for generating some data for practice analysis. Somewhat random, but seeded with some genuine stats to produce realistic looking data. The plan is it shall be modularised for different purposes.

Seed data sources are referenced throughout. http://www.abs.gov.au/ is used heavily.
